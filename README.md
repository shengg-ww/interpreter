# FlareScript

FlareScript is a lightweight, high level general purpose programming language that serves as a learning experience. I learnt how the interpeter 
works, from the lexer, parser and evaluator.
The intepreter and the programming language is built using the Rust Programming Language

## Syntax

#### To output a statement
To print a statement, the display method is used.

display("Hello World") # string statements

display(187) # numeric types

display(x) # variable

#### Declaring a variable

Declaring a variable is done using the let constructur. FlareScript is dynamically typed, so we need not specify data types upon declaration.

let x = 10

#### Data Types

Booleans: True, False, None

#### Control Flow

Standard if, elif and else are used here.
We define our control flow condtion 

if (condition) {
...
}

elif (condition) {
...
}

else {
...
}
